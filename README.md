DirectoryWalker is a Python script that allows you to scan and list the contents of a directory. It's a handy tool for quickly exploring the files and subdirectories within a folder.

## 🧰 Usage

Run the script with the `-p` or `--path` argument to specify the directory you want to scan:

```bash
python main.py -p /path/to/your/directory
